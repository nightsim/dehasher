Simple, really fast build of a django project running hashcat...

in Views.py update:

    hash_type = 'NTLM'
    wordlist_location = './wordlist.txt'
    output_file = './output.txt'
    hash_file = './hashfile.txt'

To match the locations of wordlists, etc... After updating these lines of code, simply deploy over the instance containing hashcat. Then just access /executor/stream/ endpoint and wait for the process to complete...
Tech stack: python + django, bulma... soon to be more javascript tasks, actual parametrisation, usage of a login... an API endpoint to run the dehash... whatever comes next, blah...
Work in progress...
